# RPG-Mechanics-Test
Testing mechanics of rpg project
This project was my first attempt at a game so its very messy.
I apologize for my lack of comments in the code.

This project tests animation states, movement mechanics, combat systems, inventory system, and enemy movement and combat.
Movement Mechanics:
  Currently you can move with WASD and dash with space.
Combat Systems:
  To be able to use the combat, press "F" on the red book. Then press "E" to access the spell inventory and select the spell there. Then press "Q" and select the red book again and now you should be able to attack using "left click". I'm sorry the process is so tedious.
  The blue book is a work in progress but is supposed to be an AOE lightning spell. It can be used by following the same process above and only works with right-click facing down.
 Inventory System:
  There are two inventories that you can access. You can access the "General Inventory" with "Q" and a "Spell Inventory" with "E".
 Enemy Movement:
  The enemies use A* pathfinding that is only activated once the player enters their range.
 Enemy Combat:
  Currently, the enemies only do AOE attacks around them. The slime has an attack animation but the mushroom does not have that.
